This folder uses the random coefficients demand model to explain some coding ideas.

- [blp.jmd](blp.jmd) has an initial draft of the share equation and code for various ways to integrate out the random coefficients. Use Quarto to render it into reveal.js slides.
- [src/integrate.jl](src/integrate.jl) reorganize the integration methods
