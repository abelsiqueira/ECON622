- ["A Macroeconomic Model with a Financial Sector" Brunnermeier, Markus Konrad and Sannikov, Yuliy](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2160894)
  - continuous time model, equilibrium is characterized by system of 2nd order ODE. 
- ["Estimating HANK Models with Neural Networks" by Kase, Melosi, and Rottner (2022)](https://www.tse-fr.eu/sites/default/files/TSE/documents/sem2022/bdf/rottner.pdf)
  - uses neural networks both to approximate policy functions, and to approximate eq(parameters) over parameters, and likelihood integrated over unobserved states
- ["Why Does Return Predictability Concentrate in Bad Times?" Cujean and Hasler](http://www.juliencujean.com/CH.pdf)
  - continuous time model. seems like the paper derives a closed-form approximation to the model, and then simulates it. not sure though. paper doesn't say anything about computation  
- ["Using disaster-induced closures to evaluate discrete choice models of hospital demand" Raval, Rosenbaum, Wilson (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-2171.12421)
- ["Estimating Matching Games with Transfers" Fox (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE823)
