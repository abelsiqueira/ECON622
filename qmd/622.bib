 abstract = {This paper describes a method for estimating and testing nonlinear rational expectations models directly from stochastic Euler equations. The estimation procedure makes sample counterparts to the population orthogonality conditions implied by the economic model close to zero. An attractive feature of this method is that the parameters of the dynamic objective functions of economic agents can be estimated without explicitly solving for the stochastic equilibrium.},

     abstract = {This paper develops techniques for empirically analyzing demand and supply in differentiated products markets and then applies these techniques to analyze equilibrium in the U.S. automobile industry. Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

    abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

abstract={Efforts in providing high-quality scientific software are hardly rewarded, as scientific output is typically measured in terms of publications in high ranking journals. As a result, scientific software is often developed without proper documentation and support of modern software design patterns. Ready-to-use project skeletons can be employed to accelerate the development process, while at the same time taking care of the implementation of best practices in software engineering. In this work, we revisit best practices in software engineering and review existing project skeletons. Special emphasis is given on the realization of best practices. Finally, we present a new project skeleton for scientific writing in , which takes care of the attainment of best practices, adapted for being used in academic publications.},

abstract = {Abstract Empirical economics and econometrics (EEE) research now relies primarily on the application of code to data sets. Handling the workflow that links data sets, programs, results, and finally manuscript(s) is essential if one wishes to reproduce results. Herein, we highlight the importance of “reproducible research” in EEE and propose three simple principles to follow: organize your work, code for others, and automate as much as you can. The first principle, “organize your work”, deals with the overall organization of files and the documentation of a research workflow. “Code for others” emphasizes that we should take care in how we write code that has to be read by others or later by our future self. Finally, “automate as much as you can” is a proposal to avoid any manual treatment and to automate most, if not all, of the steps used in a research process to reduce errors and increase reproducibility. As software is not always the problem and will never be the solution, we illustrate these principles with good habits and tools, with a particular focus on their implementation in most popular software and languages in applied economics.},

abstract = {In econometric applications it is common that the exact form of a conditional expectation is unknown and having flexible functional forms can lead to improvements over a pre-specified functional form, especially if they nest some successful parametric economically-motivated forms. Series method offers exactly that by approximating the unknown function based on k basis functions, where k is allowed to grow with the sample size n to balance the trade off between variance and bias. In this work we consider series estimators for the conditional mean in light of four new ingredients: (i) sharp LLNs for matrices derived from the non-commutative Khinchin inequalities, (ii) bounds on the Lebesgue factor that controls the ratio between the L∞ and L2-norms of approximation errors, (iii) maximal inequalities for processes whose entropy integrals diverge at some rate, and (iv) strong approximations to series-type processes. These technical tools allow us to contribute to the series literature, specifically the seminal work of Newey (1997), as follows. First, we weaken considerably the condition on the number k of approximating functions used in series estimation from the typical k2/n→0 to k/n→0, up to log factors, which was available only for spline series before. Second, under the same weak conditions we derive L2 rates and pointwise central limit theorems results when the approximation error vanishes. Under an incorrectly specified model, i.e. when the approximation error does not vanish, analogous results are also shown. Third, under stronger conditions we derive uniform rates and functional central limit theorems that hold if the approximation error vanishes or not. That is, we derive the strong approximation for the entire estimate of the nonparametric function. Finally and most importantly, from a point of view of practice, we derive uniform rates, Gaussian approximations, and uniform confidence bands for a wide collection of linear functionals of the conditional expectation function, for example, the function itself, the partial derivative function, the conditional average partial derivative function, and other similar quantities. All of these results are new.}
